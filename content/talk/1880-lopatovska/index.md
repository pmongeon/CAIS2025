title: Addressing Teen Mental Health Needs at Individual and Community Levels 
abstract: "The study explored how to support teen resilience by examining the experiences of adolescents in the U.S. and Ukraine. Semi-structured interviews with parents from the U.S. and Ukraine were used to investigate the emotional distress experienced by adolescents and the resilience strategies and resources they use. Ukrainian and U.S. parentsâ€™ reports share many similarities and demonstrate the importance of community institutions in supporting teens. Findings suggest that libraries can support adolescents by offering curated content and mental health assistance and by providing safe spaces (digital and physical) to obtain information and socialize with peers."
