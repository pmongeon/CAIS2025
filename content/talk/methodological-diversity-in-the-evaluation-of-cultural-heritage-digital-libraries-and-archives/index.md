title: "Methodological Diversity in the Evaluation of Cultural Heritage Digital Libraries and Archives: Approaches, Frameworks, and Methods"
abstract: "The evaluation of digital libraries has been a topic of increasing importance in information science research, yet there has been minimal evaluative work focusing on digital cultural heritage. The objective of this paper is to report on a comprehensive review of methodologies, theoretical frameworks and techniques used in the evaluation of cultural heritage digital libraries and archives. Empirical studies are examined to identify evaluation models, frameworks, and methodologies in the literature and to categorize these past evaluative approaches. Through the classification of evaluative types and trends, we aim to develop a set of guidelines and recommendations for the future evaluation of cultural heritage digital libraries and archives."
