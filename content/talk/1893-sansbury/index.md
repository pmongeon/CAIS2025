title: The Librarianâ€™s Role in Fostering Positive School-Wide Reading Culture in Georgia Schools
abstract: "This study examines how librarians in Georgia's K-12 public schools foster positive reading cultures. Using qualitative research, it explores how librarians promote reading engagement by creating inviting library spaces, curating diverse collections, developing programs that encourage reading for pleasure and academic growth, and collaborating with school community members. The research is guided by the Reading Culture framework, adapted from a combination of the cultures framework and the Expectancy-Value Theory of Achievement Motivation. This framework contextualizes how librarians influence reading culture through resources, programming, and relationships. This study's findings contain best practices for encouraging student reading engagement and increased literacy growth."
