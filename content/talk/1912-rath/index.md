title: Document Analysis and Information Behavior of Pre-Service Teacher Perceptions of ChatGPT Generated Lesson Plans
abstract: "This study examined documents produced by generative artificial intelligence as well as usersâ€™ perceptions of the usefulness of the documents themselves. The researchers performed document analysis on two generations of lesson plans created with ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4o. Additionally, three semesters of pre-service childhood educators also reviewed the lesson plans for accuracy and adherence to their course assignment goals. This poster will share findings and trends as well as implications for information practice use of as generative artificial intelligence increases in higher education."
