title: "Aging in place with public libraries: Problematizations of (older) age in Canadian public library policies"
abstract: "Aging in place, that is, aging in one’s home and surrounding community for as long as possible, is a desire and expectation of both older adults and government agencies as it presumes independence for the former and savings for the latter. Within a broader research program that aims to unpack public libraries’ role and response to aging communities, this paper applies Carol Bacchi’s WPR analytical tool (What’s the Problem Represented to Be?) to structure the analysis of five Ontario public library systems’ policy documents. In examining the often-unnoticed assumptions surrounding age embedded in these policy texts, this paper critically explores and imagines the possibilities of public library branches as community infrastructures that contribute to sustainable and engaged age-friendly communities."
