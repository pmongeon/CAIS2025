title: "Reimagining Scholarly Communication through Experiential Learning: Merging Theory and Practice for MLIS Students"
abstract: "The lack of consistent training for scholarly authors, peer reviewers, and editors is a problem across disciplines, but it is one that affects academic librarians in a unique variety of ways. Like instructional faculty, academic librarians are generally required to engage in scholarly activity, but they are also increasingly in the position of providing guidance on and advocating for emerging trends in scholarly communication. This presentation will describe how the creation of a student-run journal and an associated scholarly communication course in Western Universityâ€™s Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS) are helping to meet this need."
