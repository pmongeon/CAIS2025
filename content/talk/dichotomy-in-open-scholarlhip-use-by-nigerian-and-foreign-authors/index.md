title: "Digital archiving by Nigerian and foreign authors in a low resource context: A Content Analysis of publications on Natural Language Processing of Nigerian Languages"
abstract: "This study investigated if there is a difference in the number of articles, datasets and computer codes that foreign and Nigerian authors of scientific publications on natural language processing (NLP) of Nigerian languages deposited in online digital archives. Relevant articles were systematically retrieved from Google, Web of Science and Scopus. Authorship type and data archiving information was extracted from the full text of the relevant publications. Result shows that papers with foreign authorship (80.4%) published their articles in non-commercial repositories, more than papers with Nigerian authorship (55.3%). Similarly, few papers with foreign authorship deposited research data (19.1%) and computer codes (10.4%), while none of the papers with Nigerian authorship did. It was recommended that librarians in Nigeria should create awareness on the benefits of digital archiving and open science."
