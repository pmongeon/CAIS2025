title: Theorizing Improved NLP Features for Promoting Behavior that Supports CMC Usersâ€™ Subjective Well-Being
abstract: "This work-in-progress identifies gaps in the current Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches for pro-social communication detection by organizing the state-of-the-art NLP feature detection approaches according to models of Subjective Well-Being (SWB) from Positive Psychology. We need to better understand the current state of the field and what features of prosocial computer-mediated communication (CMC) we have yet to address."
