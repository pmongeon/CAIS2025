title: What does a librarian look like? Understanding undergraduate student perceptions of librarians
abstract: "Enduring stereotypes and contemporary discourse surrounding librarianship as a profession may influence students’ decisions to use the library and to consider librarianship as a viable career path. This pilot study explores undergraduate students’ perceptions of librarians using a drawing activity. Participants were asked to draw a librarian and to provide a description of their drawing using the draw-and-tell or draw-and-write technique. They were also asked to complete a brief survey with questions focused on participant demographics and library use. Study findings may inform recruitment, marketing, and outreach efforts."
