title: Personal and Professional Information Behaviours of Comic and Graphic Novel Librarians in Toronto
abstract: "This poster will present findings from a study of the information behaviours of librarians in the Greater Toronto Area who work with comic and graphic novel collections across academic, school, and special library contexts. This project extends Sonnenwald et al.’s (2001) information horizon interview (IHI) methodology, considering how different situations and contexts influences information behaviours and comparing. This poster will describe data collection with 11 participants; outline findings from thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2019), compare findings with Hektor’s (2001) information activities; and showcase drawings created by participants to promote visual methodologies in LIS."
