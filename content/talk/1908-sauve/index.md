title: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research by Canadian Library and Information Science Academics and Practitioners
abstract: "The intersection of consumer rights and corporate control is exemplified in the battle over automotive repairability, where claims of cybersecurity risks challenge the Right to Repair movement. This study critically examines challenges to Massachusetts' Data Access Law, which sought to expand independent access to vehicle telematics data for purposes of diagnosis, maintenance, and repair. Through critical discourse analysis, the findings expose rhetorical strategies that prioritize corporate interests under the guise of safety. This research emphasizes the need for policy interventions that prioritize transparency and innovation and recognize that robust security and equitable access to repair can coexist."
