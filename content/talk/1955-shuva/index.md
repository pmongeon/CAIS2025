title: Employment-related information experiences of Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City
abstract: "This work in progress paper presents findings from 26 semi-structured interviews with Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City, focusing on their employment-related information experiences. It examines the role of personal networks such as friends, family, and co-ethnic community members in providing employment-related information before and after arrival. In this study, while some participants reported receiving helpful and timely employment-related information and support, others encountered outdated, vague, or misleading information and advice. Initial findings of this underscore immigrantsâ€™ complex, culturally situated employment-related information experiences and offer valuable insights for scholars in information science, migration studies, public policy, and related disciplines."
