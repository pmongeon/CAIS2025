title: "The Arcades Project as Ideal Library"
abstract: "This paper uses Alberto Manguel’s (2010) “Notes Towards a Definition of the Ideal Library” as a starting point to examine the ways in which various writers have tried to characterize, describe, and idealize library spaces and institutions, both real and imagined. I then use Manguel’s thought that “certain books […], in themselves, are an ideal library” (269) to answer the simple yet complex question: In what ways does Walter Benjamin’s The Arcades Project (1999) have the qualities of an ideal library? I conclude with some lessons for other—brick-and-mortar and virtual—libraries"
