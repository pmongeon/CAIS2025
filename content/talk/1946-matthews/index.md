title: “WHY SHOULD I STAY?” CANADIAN BLACK YOUTH AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES
abstract: "This study used narrative inquiry and critical approaches to race to explore Black youth perceptions of public libraries and community-based programs. The study was conducted in Ontario with youth aged 13 to 24 and parents of youth. Data was drawn from semi-structured interviews with youth and parents and an arts-based qualitative tool. Libraries were identified as safe and welcoming community spaces. However, youth feel poorly represented and seek youth programs with a race-conscious and inclusive approach. Core recommendations include equitable approaches to representation, strengthening relationships with partner organizations, and addressing performative approaches to inclusion."
