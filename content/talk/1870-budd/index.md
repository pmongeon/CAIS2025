title: Information, the Library, and Late(r) Capitalist Ideology
abstract: "Society today may be seen to be, in the words of Guy Debord, a spectacle. This essay examines what exactly that means, within the context of a state of later capitalism. There are attacks on the library and on information as people tend to take belief to equal knowledge. The entirety of the present state of affairs is looked at with capitalism and ideology taken into account. The plausibility of ideas constitutes the ultimate measuring stick."
