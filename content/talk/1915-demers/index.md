title: Accessibility policies in libary and information science
abstract: "Services to persons with disabilities is a topic of interest across library and information science (LIS). The Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) had had a policy in place since 1998. The American Library Association (ALA) has provided a guidance policy since 2001. The Canadian Federation of Library Associations (CFLA) released their guidance policy in 2016. This paper presents a thematic analysis of these three policies to better understand how services to persons with disabilities is conceptualized."
