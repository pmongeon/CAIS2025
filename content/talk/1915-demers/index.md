title: "Applying LLMs and Semantic Technologies for Data Extraction in Literature Reviews: A Pilot Study in LIS"
abstract: "This pilot study evaluates the capabilities of two LLMs, Mistral Small 3.1 and GPT-4o mini, in performing ontology-based data extraction to support literature reviews in library and information science (LIS). A sample of four published systematic reviews was selected as ground truth data. The open-access publications included in these reviews (n = 47) were collected as inputs for the models to perform semantic information extraction, using classes from the Document Components Ontology (DoCO). These preliminary findings highlight the opportunities and challenges of using AI and semantic technologies to streamline literature reviews in the social sciences."
