title: '"Like a splinter had come out of her": A poetic inquiry of shared reading'
abstract: "Poetry offers a valuable resource at this moment of need for language that not only informs but also connects, enacts, and creates. With this paper, I present a selection of findings from the poetic inquiry phase of my doctoral research examining what happens when we bring people together to read aloud and discuss literary works. I create and share three sets of poems: found poems from the transcripts of my interviews with reading group participants, found poems from the work of relevant theorists, and threshold poems that weave in my voice as the poet-researcher. The poems reveal how the cultivated liminal space of shared reading can engender a practice of listening otherwise experienced as a process of relational wellbeing."
