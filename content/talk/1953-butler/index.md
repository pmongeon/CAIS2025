title: "An Evidence-Based Approach to Advancing Open Science at the University of Ottawa: Experiences from the Open Science Working Group"
abstract: "In 2023 uOttawa formed an Open Science Working Group (OSWG) charged with examining the current state of open science at uOttawa, working to define uOttawaâ€™s goals towards open research practices, and recommending an action plan to position uOttawa as an open science leader. Monthly meetings and the final report of the OSWG were informed by a strong evidence base including analyses of uO research output, expenditure on OA fees, and open science policies and practices. This paper provides a detailed account of these processes and methods which can offer insights to institutions aiming to develop their own open science strategies."
