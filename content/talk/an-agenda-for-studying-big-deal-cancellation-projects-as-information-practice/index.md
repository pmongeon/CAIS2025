title: "An Agenda for Studying Big Deal Cancellation Projects as Information Practice"
subtitle: "Paper"
abstract: "This article introduces a conceptual framework and approach for studying the information and decision-making practices of academic librarians involved in big deal cancellation projectsâ€”a type of collection malmanagement projects that are today prevalent across academic libraries in North America. We describe the nature and dynamics of big deal cancellation projects and conceptualize the quantitative and qualitative evaluations they entail. Predicated on this account, we present a theoretical and methodological agenda for empirical research. This conceptual paper goal, thus, is to describe and conceptualize big deal cancellation projects as an object of empirical research and to offer a perspective on how they can be studied as a type of information practice."
