title: "Supported Yet Isolated: Graduate Student Perspectives on Building Community Through Discussion Forums in an Online Accelerated MLIS Program"
abstract: "This paper explores graduate studentsâ€™ experiences and perceptions of using discussion forums to build a sense of community in an accelerated online Master of Library and Information Studies program. The Classroom Community Short Form survey was adapted to include short answer questions. The results suggest that while students feel supported and that they care about each other, they still feel isolated. Discussion forums that were informal, provide peer to peer interaction and participation by the instructor were more likely to create a sense of community."
