title: "A Review of Library Associations Websites to Learn about Decolonizing Efforts"
abstract: "CFLA-FCABâ€™s Truth and Reconciliation Report and Recommendations (2017) has galvanized Canadian libraries and library associations to undertake initiatives to decolonize libraries. Similar efforts are happening internationally as libraries work toward reconciliation. This paper presents findings of an analysis of library association websites from Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, demonstrating how library associations endorse action toward decolonization through publicly shared content. Library associations use their websites to engage with decolonization in various ways, whether through sharing resource lists and blog posts (common in US and Canada), or through publishing standards and protocols (common in Australia and New Zealand)."
