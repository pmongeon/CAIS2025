title: "Preparing for the Worst: An Analysis of Disaster Response Resource Provision by Canadian Library Associations"
abstract: "This paper examines how Canadian Library Associations (CLAs) provide support to the public libraries and librarians they empower in the areas of disaster preparation and mitigation. Utilizing qualitative content analysis, this study compared the resources and supports offered by 18 CLAs. The information, websites, and internal documents provided by the CLAs were assessed and coded using constant comparative methodology according to a) the type of resource and b) the type(s) of information contained in each resource. In total 8 categories of resources and 16 categories of information were established. Additionally, three concerning trends regarding the information currently being provided by the CLAs were discovered."
