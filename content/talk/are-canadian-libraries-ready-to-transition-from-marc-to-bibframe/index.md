title: "Are Canadian Libraries Ready to Transition from MARC to BIBFRAME?"
abstract: "This project seeks to assess the Canadian library communityâ€™s understanding of and readiness for the transition from the MARC format to the BIBFRAME model. Data were collected using a survey distributed in English and French to a stratified random sample of 1,200 Canadian libraries. Results indicate that knowledge of BIBFRAME is low among respondents and that most of the libraries surveyed do not know enough about BIBFRAME to consider planning a transition at this point."
