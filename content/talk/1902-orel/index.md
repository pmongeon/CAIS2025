abstract: "This research uses content analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of current trends in Information Architecture (IA) for Information Management (IM). It clarifies the IA concept, its elements, design practices, and methodologies. Additionally, it explores the education, roles, and skillsets expected of information architects in todayâ€™s job market. This research can be used to train IA stakeholders, define information architect responsibilities, standardize terminology, and develop best practices and standards for IA design.
