title: " Alternative scholarship through table-top games: A practical demonstration (Panel)"
abstract: Research can take many forms, especially in a field as diverse as
  library studies. This panel will bring together several emerging scholars as
  they navigate current Library and Information Science issues through the
  medium of role-playing games. It is our hope that this panel will illustrate
  how alternative scholarship can be used to teach and explore emerging issues
  in the field of LIS.
