title: "Parental HIV Disclosure: Scoping Literature Review with a Lens on Information Behavior"
abstract: "Many children have been and continue to be impacted by parents living with HIV/AIDS and disclosure of parental positive HIV/AIDS status to their children has multiple benefits. Research has been done on the prevalence and influencing factors of parental HIV disclosure however many identified gaps in research have not yet been fulfilled. The application of an information behavior theoretical framework may enable an opportunity to fulfill such research gaps. This is a scoping literature review that aims to align previously identified research findings about parental HIV disclosure to opportunities that may benefit from the application of information behavior theory and answer the questions: 1) What research has been done about parental HIV disclosure? 2) How has information theory been applied to research about parental HIV/AIDS disclosure?"
