title: "Two Row Model of Building Archival Collections An Indigenous Information Policy Perspective"
abstract: "This current 6,500 word paper addresses the Two Row Wampum as a policy model for archival collections. This paper and subsequent presentation will provide an overview of mainstream archival practices and how they are utilized in First Nation communities, and special libraries collecting or holding Indigenous materials. This paper is intended to be both practical and theoretical as the questions and points made are a tableau or road map of query. Additionally, this paper provides literature support in the form of arguments from some of the leading Indigenous Researchers, albeit outside of the field of Information Sciences.

This paper will address the three A’s of archival work identified by Cuervo (2015): Appraisal, Acquisition, Access.  Added to this is a fourth: Action, taken on by those Information Scientists who practice social justice throughout their librarianship. This is addressed throughout several sections including one on decolonizing the library and archive, content management and integrated library system software, the impacts of recent campaigns on social justice action of librarians such as the Idle No More and Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women (and Girls), and Empowering Others.      

This paper concludes with a recommendation of policy which embraces the arguments made within the text, framing it within the Two Row Wampum. While a specifically Indigenous argument, this paper clearly has a home within the Diverging Trajectories in Information Science theme for 2020."
