title: "Cycles of Bias: Soft Censorship in Libraries"
abstract: "Library professionals, often without knowing, can indirectly reduce access to information, a phenomenon known as soft censorship. This research-in-progress conceptualizes key aspects of soft censorship and identifies conditions conducive to soft censorship in libraries. The individual and systematic biases that form the cycles that facilitate soft censorship become evident through this conceptualization, including content warnings, neutrality, subject headings, hiring, and publishing. In future work, we will analyze other areas where soft censorship has the potential to proliferate, including acquisitions, weeding, and reference, to obtain a fuller picture of soft censorship."
