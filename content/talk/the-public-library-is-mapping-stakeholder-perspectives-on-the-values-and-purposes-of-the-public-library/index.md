title: The public library is....; mapping stakeholder perspectives on the values
  and purposes of the public library
abstract: "We used survey responses and statements of library organizations to create a corpus of items describing the value of public libraries.  A sample of public library users and staff from the province of Ontario individually sorted these statements into groups and labelled the groups, and rated each statement with respect to its general importance, its centrality to the mission of the public library, and its uniqueness to the public library.  We used GroupWisdomâ„¢ software to analyze individual responses into an overall concept map and to identify differences in patterns across different participant groups."
