title: "Extreme Sport and Information: Initial Findings of Technical Cave Diverâ€™s Information-Seeking Behaviours"
abstract: "Using the participatory, arts-based information world mapping (IWM) method, this study investigated the information-seeking behaviors of cave divers before, during, and after cave dives. Cave diving is considered an extreme sport, in which technical divers trained in overhead environments penetrate flooded cave systems. 20 participants were interviewed using the IWM technique and semi-structured open-ended questions. Verbatim clean transcriptions and participant maps were coded using thematic content analysis. Participant data suggests cave divers may be intentionally restrictive in their information-sharing behaviors, choosing vetted contacts willing to reciprocate information exchanges."
