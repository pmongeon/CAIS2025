title: "Understanding Digital Literacy Training Success An Exploration Across Canada"
abstract: "This paper reports progress of a SSHRC-funded research investigation that studies the factors affecting the success of digital literacy skills training offered by community-led organizations, such as public libraries, across Canada. The goal of the study is to identify best practices. The study also seeks to contribute to the theoretical understanding of digital literacy instruction led by community organizations. This paper reports preliminary results of the analysis of interviews with administrators and instructors from organizations in Canada which offer such training, as well as from interviews and surveys collected from people who took part in these organizationsâ€™ training activities."
