title: "Student and librarian perspectives on information literacy: Finding opportunity in divergence"
abstract: "This paper reports the results of a study focused on the implementation of the ACRL Framework in community college libraries. The study explores information literacy instruction practices in this context, comparing librarians’ and students’ perspectives. Librarians with instructional responsibilities were surveyed, and students are being interviewed, to explore divergence in their perspectives, as has been reported elsewhere, and to identify opportunities to improve instructional practice."
