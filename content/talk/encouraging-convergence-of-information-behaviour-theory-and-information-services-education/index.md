title: "Encouraging Convergence of Information Behaviour Theory and Information Services Education"
abstract: "Information behaviour theory, models, and concepts (IB TMCs) are foundational for effective reference and information services (RIS) and yet they are not widely addressed in basic RIS courses. This study explores how librarianship students are being educated in IB TMCs. Course syllabi and assigned textbooks of RIS courses were analyzed for integration of IB TMCs. This analysis is followed by a survey of instructors of these courses to determine key factors in integration of IB TMCs. Preliminary results indicate that treatment of IB TMCs remain limited and suggest that IB scholars may have an impact on the integration of their work."
