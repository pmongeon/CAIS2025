title: "Library SCEB Model: Advocating Positive Psychology Interventions in Library Settings"
abstract: "Library SCEB is a model that reframes library practices by building on elements from prominent theories in the positive psychology movement. We assert that certain types of space redesign (S), collection building (C), innovative events and programming (E), and bibliotherapy (B) are closely aligned with Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs), which have been found experimentally to successfully improve subjective wellbeing (positive emotions, engagement, character strengths) in several disciplines, including education, health care, and organizational studies. We identify challenges with the Library SCEB efforts and recommend strategies for further integration of PPIs in the context of academic, public, and school librarianship."
