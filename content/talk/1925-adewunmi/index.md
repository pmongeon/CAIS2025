title: "Black Women In STEM: Reimagining the Role of Information Science as a Pathway to STEM Equity in the United States"
abstract: "The persistent underrepresentation of Black women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields is largely attributed to their race and gender. With measures and interventions being continually undertaken to attain race and gender parity in STEM workforce, there is a lack of information science-based approaches in literature and practice. This might account for the less progress and increase recorded in the participation of Black women in the profession. This gap in STEM fields is an issue of national importance that seeks urgent solution. This paper aims to highlight the experiences of Black women in STEM, and implications for policy and practice."
