title: Learning from fictional characters: an information behavior perspective
abstract: "Reading fiction is an important information behavior, but systematic study in our field about fiction has been sparse. This paper is part of continuing research about how fiction is informative. It reviews work about the ontological status of literary characters and how they can affect and inform us, especially in creating and contesting social boundaries, based in part on a small empirical study (n=8) of adult readers’ reading as adolescents. Such work helps us to understand important elements of people’s information behavior too often ignored."
