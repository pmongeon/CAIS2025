title: Exploring Alternative Formats of University-Community Engaged Knowledge Mobilization 
abstract: "This paper discusses the use of alternative formats (e.g., videos, clear language summaries, infographics) in scholarly communication and knowledge mobilization. We draw upon two examples: 1) a community-engaged learning project (2019–present) and 2) a multiyear research project (2018–2023), both connected to a larger university-community initiative to make research accessible to non-university audiences. We focus on the use of alternative formats within these projects and efforts to evaluate their value for various constituents, e.g., students, instructors, researchers, and community participants. We report on what we have learned through these projects and argue that it is critical to understand the utility of alternative formats to motivate scholars to mobilize their work and to support research use amongst community knowledge users."
