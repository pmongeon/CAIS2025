title: Accessibility policies in libary and information science
abstract: "The information structures, styles and priorities of those in the disabled community are vastly different from those that make up academic culture, creating a disparity between the needs of disabled students and the support of the university accommodations system. With mixed methods data that describes the post-secondary accommodations system, a model of overlapping frames of information access and use could be created that would allow for an in-depth analysis of information and the disabled post-secondary experience. In addition to contributing to the literature on post-secondary disability and accessibility, this research will also produce concrete recommendations to improve post-secondary accommodations systems."
