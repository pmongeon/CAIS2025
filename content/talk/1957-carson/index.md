title: "Supporting Global Equity in Documentary Heritage with a Free, Minimal Computing Solution for Creating Sustainable and Accessible Digital Exhibitions: The Case of Zulima"
abstract: "The Global South’s documentary heritage is less online than the Global North’s and tools and methods are needed for enhancing the discoverability of collections where resources are constrained. The Zulima collection, late 19th- and early 20th-century documents pertaining to an important female Venezuelan author and playwright is a collection at risk of being lost as there are currently no memory institutions in Venezuela that can safely keep it. This project proposes a way to expand on existing metadata management software, SWALLOW, minimal web templates, a data export to Wikidata, and free asset hosting, to make this collection available online and accessible for future researchers."
