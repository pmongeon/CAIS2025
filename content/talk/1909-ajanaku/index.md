title: "Organizational Culture as a Catalyst for Effective Knowledge Management in Healthcare Delivery among Nurses: Exploring the Link Between Culture and Knowledge Processes in Nursing Practice"
abstract: "This study investigated the relationship between organizational culture and knowledge management process (acquisition, conversion, application, and protection) among registered nurses at Obafemi Awolowo Teaching Hospitals Complex in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Employing a quantitative descriptive survey, a proportionate stratified sampling method was utilized to select a sample size of 126 registered nurses from a total of 756. Questionnaires were administered and a total of 111 questionnaires were collected for analysis resulting in a response rate of 89.5%.  Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant and positive relationships between organizational culture and the four dimensions of knowledge management process. The findings underscore the crucial role of organizational culture in supporting effective knowledge management within healthcare delivery. This research contributes to understanding knowledge management as a strategic tool for improving health outcomes and advocates for the integration of supportive cultures to optimize nursing care delivery within the context of South-West Nigeria."
