title: Conceptualizations of Information Science by Large Language Models
abstract: "This paper reports a comparative study of how large language models understand and represent the domain of information science. Five large language models were selected for this study, namely ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, Google Gemini, Meta AI and Claude. A set of five prompts was utilized in this study for comparison. The findings suggest differences and variations in how these LLMs conceptualize and represent information science, its definitions, and interdisciplinarity, theoretical models, and methods."
