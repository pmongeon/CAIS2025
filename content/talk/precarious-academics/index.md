title: "Precarious academics: Information practices and challenges"
abstract: "This paper reports the results of a small-scale study of the information practices of contract academic staff in the United Kingdom, which is being used as the basis for a broader study in the Canadian context. Neoliberal approaches to the management of higher education across the globe, including Canada, are contributing to a highly challenging environment for contract academic staff, who face marginalization, insecurity, and significant stress. The study seeks to give voice to this growing complement of contract academic staff, to identify practical responses to these challenges."
