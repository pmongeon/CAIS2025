title: "Towards a Normative Framework for AI Governance"
abstract: "AI governance is an area of research and practice which seeks to understand and control “the institutions and contexts in which AI is built and used” (Dafoe, 2018, p. 5). Despite the importance of institutions to AI governance, the influence that institutional dynamics play in the development of systems and strategies of AI governance has not yet been rigorously studied. Moreover, the cognitive ecology and evolutionary potential associated with AI practices are crucial aspects of AI governance systems, yet those factors have largely gone unconsidered in the research and practice of AI governance to date. This project attempts to bridge those gaps in research and practice through a four-phase research process involving a comparative analysis of AI governance strategies, a review and synthesis of the AI governance literature, the development of an ontology of AI goverance systems, and an in-depth case study of an AI governance system."
