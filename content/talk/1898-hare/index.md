title: "Reading the province: Creating a multiliteracy assessment framework for Nova Scotia"
abstract: "This scoping review uses systematic review methodology to survey literature on established and emerging forms of literacy and their measurement, focusing on scholarly and grey literature published since 2014. Findings emphasize the need for standardized yet context-sensitive evaluation frameworks, acknowledging regional disparities, cultural contexts, and emerging domains like digital literacy. Key challenges include reflecting multifaceted literacy outcomes such as social connection, independence, and confidence. The study was undertaken to provide an evidence base for the non-profit organization Literacy Nova Scotia as they seek to survey the state of literacy in Nova Scotia. The next phase involves a Delphi study to gather insights from Nova Scotian literacy experts, informing robust, inclusive assessment frameworks."
