title: Public Library-Led Digital Literacy Training to Older Adults in Social Housing 
abstract: "This paper describes an in-progress two-cycled Action Research investigation of public library-led digital literacy training to older adults in social housing. Prior to the first cycle, the digital literacy needs and training preferences of CityHousing Hamilton (CHH) older adults were identified. These findings were then used to design and evaluate an Android tablet training program delivered by Hamilton Public Library (HPL) to CHH older adults onsite at their CHH place of residence (Cycle One). Findings from Cycle One were then used to design and implement another iteration of onsite HPL-led tablet training to CHH seniors (Cycle Two)."
