title: "Librarian Use of the Knowledge Practices and Dispositions in the ACRL Framework"
abstract: "This poster details the findings of an investigation of US academic instruction librarians’ use of the knowledge practices and dispositions in the Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education from the Association of College and Research Libraries (2016). The Framework is a departure from the previous set of standards, but is often critiqued for being too theoretical and therefore not relevant to practice. In order to investigate the extent to which academic librarians use this theoretically-grounded document in practice, a questionnaire and interview study was conducted. This questionnaire explored librarian preparation in library science and education; familiarity with the frames, knowledge practices, and dispositions; examples of how, if at all, the knowledge practices and dispositions are implemented in information literacy instruction; and barriers with implementing the Framework. Follow up interviews investigated more deeply how various parts of the Framework were implemented in librarians’ daily work."
