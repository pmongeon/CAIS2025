title: "Accessibility policies in libary and information science"
abstract: "Services to persons with disabilities is a topic of interest across library and information science (LIS). The American Library Association (ALA) has provided a guidance policy since 2001. The Canadian Federation of Library Associations (CFLA) released their guidance policy in 2016. The questions of interest centre around how these policies are framed individually, what kinds of comparative analysis can be made, and what kind of guidance they provide for Canadian libraries. This paper analyzes the CFLA and ALA guidelines using Bacchi’s, ‘what’s the problem presented to be’ policy analysis. "
