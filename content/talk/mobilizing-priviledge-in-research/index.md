title: Mobilizing priviledge in research
abstract: "Homelessness, racialized youth, people with disabilities, older community members, and teens are all groups on the margins in information research. The proposed panel will represent a convergence of allyship in research focused on these marginalized communities. It adopts the approach that being an appropriate ally requires personal considerations as well as a more nuanced approach to research that is grounded in reciprocal relationships with our research communities, humility, and reflective self-education."
