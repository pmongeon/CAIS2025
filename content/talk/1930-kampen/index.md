title: "Understanding Information-Sharing of Artist-Researchers: Emerging Themes"
abstract: "This poster describes the research design and identifies emerging themes of a work-in-progress dissertation study, titled Understanding information-sharing of artist-researchers. In the context of this study artist-researcher includes individuals who self-identify as enmeshing artistic and scholarly approaches to research. The doctoral research study will provide an account and analysis of how artist-researchers share (or do not share) information among themselves and others by exploring the conditions that encourage and discourage sharing. The study considers what it means to share and be shared with, and brings attention to obscured aspects of the research process."
