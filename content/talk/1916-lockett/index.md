title: Digital Search and Health Insurance Literacy in the U.S.
abstract: "This research focuses on the impact of digital search on health information, primarily health insurance and health insurance literacy (HIL). Through the use of a Google search simulation software, this study examined the health insurance search of young adults 18-25 and evaluated their literacy using the health insurance literacy measure (HILM). With the marketing of AI to mass audiences and its introduction as a tool for search, this study incorporated AI into the search simulation and measured whether it impacted the development of HIL for the participants."
