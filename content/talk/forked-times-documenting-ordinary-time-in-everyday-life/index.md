title: 'Forked times: documenting "ordinary time" in everyday life'
abstract: “Ordinary” time is commonly defined as time that is neither holidays
  nor emergencies, which suggests that “ordinary time” events are routine rather
  than singular. An analysis of how people document events in “ordinary” time,
  however, shows that the stream of “ordinary” time has multiple forks; that
  ordinary does not necessarily mean predictable, and that both vacations and
  emergencies could, in certain circumstances, take on the character of routine
  rather than singular events.
