title: "Semantic Knowledge Management: Towards a Novel Knowledge Representation Perspective"
abstract: "The paper posits that there are at least five key interlinked representation levels which cumulatively inform the development of any Semantic Knowledge Management (SKM) model, namely, perception, language, ontology, taxonomy and description. To that end, drawing from concepts in knowledge representation, the paper illustrates how representation entanglement impacts the above representation layers culminating in an entangled final SKM model in an SKM exercise. Finally, the paper proposed a representation disentanglement approach to disentangle the aforementioned entanglement leading to the generation of a disentangled SKM model."
