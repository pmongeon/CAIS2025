title: Libraries at the End of the World
abstract: "Since 2021, libraries have become a target of organized forces seeking to suppress the stories of LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC people and our histories. Attempts to remove books from library shelves have reached record numbers while legislation in states from Florida to Idaho to Texas to Missouri have enshrined censorship into law. Such restrictions on the right to think, write, and read place libraries at the center of the fight for democracy."
