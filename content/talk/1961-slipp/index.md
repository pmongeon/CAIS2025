title: Mind your own Business? Business Database Subscriptions in Atlantic Canadian Postsecondary Libraries
abstract: "For business librarians, decision-making around database subscriptions can prove complex. Decisions made in the past, possibly by now-retired librarians, have a huge influence on what an institution offers. How can librarians be sure these past decisions reflect what is best for their libraries’ futures? This project analyses the business database holdings of Council of Atlantic Academic Libraries/ Conseil des Bibliothèques Postsecondaires de l’Atlantique (CAAL-CBPA) member libraries and national comparison schools to determine which business databases are most popular in our region. Our goal is to provide business librarians, especially early career librarians, data-based insights into collections decision making."
