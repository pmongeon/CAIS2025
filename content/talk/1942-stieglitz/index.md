title: "Advancing Environmental Sustainability in Academic Libraries: A Process-Oriented Approach"
abstract: "The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our planet, necessitating urgent action from all sectors of society, including academic institutions. Libraries, as knowledge hubs and community centers, are pivotal in promoting environmental sustainability and leading by example. This poster presentation shares the work of the University of Alberta Libraryâ€™s (UAL) Environmental Sustainability Working Group and our process-oriented approach to reducing our environmental impact. This work draws on past experiences and research to envision an environmentally sustainable future for academic libraries."
