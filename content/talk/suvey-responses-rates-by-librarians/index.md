title: "Surveying the Surveyors: An Analysis of the Survey Response Rates of Librarians"
abstract: "It is a well-established fact that the most widely employed research method by librarians is surveys. Given this fact, this ongoing study seeks to identify exactly how likely librarians are to respond to surveys and what, if any, circumstances will increase the likelihood they will respond. Using a quantitative content analysis, relevant literature from three separate LIS databases – Library Literature & Information Science Full Text (EBSCOhost), Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (EBSCOhost), and Library & Information Science Abstracts (ProQuest) – is currently being gathered and evaluated. Preliminary findings indicate trends regarding LIS research purposes, methodology, and subjects."
