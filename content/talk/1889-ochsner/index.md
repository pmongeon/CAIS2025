title: "Further to Go: The Pervasie Use of Undesirable Models and Language in Research on Neurogivergence in Academic Libraries"
abstract: "It has been suggested that LIS literature discussing neurodivergence uses undesirable models of disability and undesirable language despite growing advocacy for alternatives. We examine the models and language used in 44 works on neurodivergence and academic libraries and find that 95% of those works use undesirable language like patronising, person-first, and medicalised/deficit-focused language. The medical model is never explicitly used, but numerous works with no explicit model use medicalised/deficit-focused language. Although no works use explicitly ableist language, undesirable language is present even in works using the social model of disability. Recommendations for future research and practice are provided."
