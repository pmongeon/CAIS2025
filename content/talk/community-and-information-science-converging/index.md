title: "Community and Information Science Converging"
abstract: "The Inuvialuit Voices Project is a collaboration between the Inuvialuit Cultural Centre, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, and communities within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region to enhance the Inuvialuit Digital Library (https://inuvialuitdigitallibrary.ca/) with real-time digital storytelling functionality. In this presentation, the authors will describe the community-based methodology being used to co-develop the system, report on a recent elder storytelling gathering that was held to better understand storytelling in-context to inform the design and functionality of the system, and discuss next steps in the development process."
