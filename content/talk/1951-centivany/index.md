title: A Window into Generative Artificial Intelligence Under Copyright Law & Policy in Canada
abstract: "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) challenges and alters existing sociotechnical practices and regulatory schemes. This research provides a window into the current Canadian copyright law and policy context concerning GenAI, offering insights derived from existing legal precedent and policymaking efforts. Key issues addressed include the varied nature of policymaking processes, the copyright implications of text and data mining (TDM) and GenAI training models, the evolving roles of licensing and data curation, and ethical considerations around transparency. This work offers perspective on the current state of Canadian copyright law regarding AI and provides guidance on where future policymaking efforts and reforms are most needed."
