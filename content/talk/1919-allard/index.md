title: '"Policies and Training Empowers Staff and Management to Act": Preliminary Findings From the Patron-Perpetrated (PPSH) Policies and Procedures Survey'
abstract: "Library workers across Canada view library policy, training, and reporting as important interventions to prevent and address patron-perpetrated sexual harassment (PPSH). A nation-wide survey indicates that Canadian public libraries vary widely in their development and usage of PPSH policies, procedures, and training. While 40% of libraries surveyed have PPSH policies, 78% have patron codes of conduct and 74% have policies that address workplace violence, harassment & discrimination. Only 26% of participating libraries offer staff PPSH specific training. Of the 69% of participating libraries who had formal incident reporting processes, only 13% list sexual harassment as a reporting option. More positively, findings demonstrate a strong interest by participants to address PPSH in their workplaces."
