title: "The zero-waste lifestyle movement: A grassroots response to climate change"
abstract: "This paper examines the structure and themes of five popular ZW Instagram accounts through the theoretical lens of the Lifestyle Movement Framework. A Thematic Analysis of 2,000 posts revealed that these communities have a strong sense of cohesion and coherence. Members have a strong sense of identity as ZW practitioners, embed ZW activities in their everyday lives, and believe that their individual actions can contribute to social change."
