## Archives in Action Workshop: Toward a National Policy Action Plan for Marginalized and Vulnerable Audiovisual Archives


*Details*

Date: May 26th, 2025
Time: 2:30-4:30 pm 
Location: Room 3001, Kenneth C. Rowe Management Building, Dalhousie University
Break: 4:30-6:30 pm (Food and beverages provided)  

*Description*

This workshop brings together Indigenous filmmakers, archives practitioners, and academic researchers for a roundtable discussion on the urgent need to develop national frameworks for the preservation, access, and distribution of audiovisual materials in Mi’kma’ki and across Canada.

Film is an important medium for conveying First Nations culture, language, teaching, and history. Yet, audiovisual materials remain among the most vulnerable cultural materials due to a range of systemic challenges—insufficient preservation methods, under-resourced technical infrastructure, limited and unstable funding, and intellectual property regimes that do not support artists or communities.

Participants will explore these critical issues and actionable steps to be taken by key stakeholders, including government bodies, cultural institutions, and funding agencies. This conversation aims to shape a “manifesto for action,” setting the groundwork for a national policy agenda that recognizes, protects, and sustains Indigenous audiovisual heritage.

Register for the workshop [here](https://forms.office.com/r/sApW3zipCf). Registration will be capped at 25 participants. There is no fee to participate.
