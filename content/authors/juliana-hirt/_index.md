bio: "Juliana Hirt is a PhD candidate in the School of Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. She holds a Master of Science in Information Science and Technology and a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, both from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Her research interests focus on integrating theories of knowledge organization, information retrieval, and information communication to develop generalizable stochastic models for the optimization of information technology infrastructures.
Her current work examines the application of cognitive social constructivist approaches to knowledge organization, with a particular focus on event-driven architecture (EDA) optimization. She has also contributed to research on metadata representations for multimedia resources, including video games, anime, and fiction, and is actively engaged in studies investigating the ethical implications and affordances of artificial intelligence in librarianship and collaborative storytelling.
Juliana's research has been published in the Journal of Documentation and the proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T) and iConference. She is also involved in research initiatives supported by the American Library Association (ALA) and the Northwestern Mutual Data Science Institute (NMDSI)."
