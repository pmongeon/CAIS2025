title: Tami Oliphant
role: Department of Information Science, Dalhousie University
bio: "Tami is an associate professor at the School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Alberta. Her research draws upon intersectional feminist anti-violence theory and practice, theories of justice (particularly epistemic injustice and more recently climate justice), and other library and information studies (LIS) theory that centres people and their relationships to information institutions such as libraries, librarianship, publishing, and their social information practices. Working alongside Dr. Danielle Allard and Angela Lieu, our most recent SSHRC funded research (2024-2027) advances our findings from the Patron-Perpetrated Sexual Harassment (PPSH) in Libraries project that explores library workers’ experiences of gender-based violence in a “pink collar” profession and feminized workplace and focuses on policy and PPSH interventions."
