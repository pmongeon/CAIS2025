## Call for Papers: Canadian Association for Information Science 53rd Annual Conference: Back to the Future
  
The Canadian Association for Information Science (CAIS/ACSI) is pleased to announce its 53rd annual conference, to be held in the beautiful and vibrant oceanside city of Halifax, Nova Scotia from May 28-30, 2025. This year's theme, "Back to the Future” is a nod to our return to gathering back in person for the CAIS conference, after five years exclusively online. It also denotes the CAIS community’s over half-a-century tradition of conferring with other members of our interdisciplinary community about our shared values and mission, which we continually return to for guidance as our field evolves. Just as this theme roots us back in CAIS’ core principles of openness and inclusivity, it also turns our minds towards the future of our field. It asks: how do we draw on and learn from our past to shape our future? The researchers and practitioners comprising our community may consider where we came from, where we are going, and the threads that unite past and future, as we gather as an academic community in the present.
The 2025 conference also marks several ‘firsts’ for the CAIS/ACSI conference. CAIS heard the voices of its community about how a virtual format offers flexible and accessible participation. We are thus delighted to host CAIS 2025 in a hybrid format, and welcome both in-person or virtual attendance, or a mix of both! 
Another exciting first for the CAIS community is its partnership with Dalhousie University’s Department of Information Science annual student-run conference, Information Without Borders (IWB). We are thrilled to combine the rich tradition of Information Science students and professionals gathering for IWB in Halifax with this year’s CAIS conference, which we anticipate will contribute to a richer event and program. 
Finally, at CAIS, we believe that diversity is a strength that enriches our understanding and advances our discipline. By coming together and uniting our knowledge, we can create a vibrant mosaic of insights that reflects the complexity and diversity of the information landscape. We are happy to announce that with support from the Federation of the Social Sciences and Humanities, we are able to offer 25 registration scholarships for attendees. We welcome you to apply here:
As a reminder, the CAIS conference is free and open to all online, and free in-person to registered CAIS members. You are welcome to join CAIS at any time by registering for a (free) student, regular ($40.00), or reduced rate ($20.00) membership at any time here: https://cais-acsi.ca/membership 

CAIS is committed to embracing diversity and incorporating a range of perspectives in the field of information science. We invite researchers, practitioners, and students from across Canada to join us in exploring the many facets of information science and its impact on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. 
We encourage submissions that showcase a range of methodologies, theoretical perspectives, and areas of focus, including but not limited to:
Information behavior and seeking
Information literacy and education
Knowledge management and organization
Information technologies and systems
Social media and networking
Bibliometrics and scholarly communication
Data science 
Information policy and ethics
Cultural heritage and preservation
Health information management
Diversity, equity, and inclusion in information science


### Types of proposals

CAIS/ACSI welcomes proposals for papers, lightning talks, or panels focused on empirical, theoretical, and practice-based research. Proposals may be submitted in English or French. All proposals will undergo double-blind peer review, and should be scrubbed of personally identifying information upon initial submission.

<strong>Papers</strong>: We are seeking submissions of a variety of 20-minute oral presentations. We are particularly seeking those submissions that speak to the conference theme of “Leaps & Stumbles.”

- “Leaps and Bounds”: Completed or well-developed empirical studies suitable for publication in scholarly journals.
- “Quantum Leaps”: Rigorous theoretical, metatheoretical, conceptual, or scholarly discussions or reviews of the literature
- “Leaps of Faith”: Ongoing work or works in progress
- “Leaps to Mind”: Works from students, practicing professionals, international scholar

CAIS/ACSI is additionally happy to accept proposals on any topics under the LIS disciplinary umbrella. Diverse and innovative perspectives (theoretical and applied) and methodologies are welcome.

Proposals should be in the form of an extended abstract (approximately 1000-1500 words excluding references). Please see our <a href="Extended-Abstract-Writing-Guide.pdf">helpful advice for writing an extended abstract</a> and use <a href="CAIS-ACSI-2024-Abstract-Template.docx">this template to submit</a>. (note: if you are having difficulties downloading the template, try opening the link in a new window or tab, or using the Save as function).

<strong>Lightning Talks</strong>: Visual presentations of projects at any stage of development on topics suitable for publication in scholarly journals. Diverse perspectives (theoretical and applied) and methodologies are welcomed. Proposals should be in the form of a short abstract (maximum 750 words excluding references), reporting on research projects, theoretical developments or innovative practical applications. Presenters of accepted talks will also be invited to provide a 5-7 minute overview of their work. Please use <a href="CAIS-ACSI-2024-Abstract-Template.docx">this template</a> (note: if you are having difficulties downloading the template, try opening the link in a new window or tab, or using the Save as function).

<strong>Panels</strong>: 90-minute oral presentations from three or more authors on emerging domains, trends, or contrasting viewpoints, including time for questions or discussion. Panels are an opportunity to engage in discussion of shared concerns, including those not available in completed research or yet adequately recognized. Proposals should not be simply a set of related paper presentations; we encourage proposals that offer creative and unique opportunities for engagement and discussion with the audience as part of the panel session. We recommend three to five panelists plus a moderator; there will be an opportunity to modify the list of panelists after acceptance. Proposals should be in the form of an extended abstract (approximately 1000-1500 words excluding references, please see here for our <a href="Extended-Abstract-Writing-Guide.pdf">helpful advice for writing an extended abstract</a>), that identifies the topic to be discussed, provides an overview of the structure of the panel, and includes relevant qualifications and contributions of each participating panelist.

Proposals will be evaluated wholistically on clarity, impact/originality, overall quality, and theory/methodology as appropriate. Proposals will be received and reviewed using EasyChair: <a href = "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=caisacsi2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=caisacsi2024</a>

<strong>Doctoral / Master’s Student Research Forum</strong>: We are pleased to invite master’s and doctoral students to CAIS’s Student Research Forum. The Forum’s goal is to provide graduate students with an opportunity to present and discuss their research project, get feedback from senior researchers, and make connections with other students. Students at any stage of their graduate program are invited to submit to the Forum. Please be prepared to present informally on an aspect of your research for 5-10 minutes, which will be followed by discussion. More details will be provided upon acceptance.

To participate in the Forum, <a href="https://forms.gle/HE3t4gim3XSym6eH9">please fill out the following submission form</a>.
