# About me

I am a PhD student at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management/school-of-information-management.html)  investigating the intersection of scholarly production and information seeking & retrieval behaviours. I am currently researching query formulation and reformulation are affected by conversational AI interfaces. 
In my free time, I love being with my family, drawing and painting with my kiddo, roller skating, and stress baking!

Interests:

- Information search & retrieval
- Biblliometrics and bibliometric-enhanced information retrieval (BIR)
- Exploratory Search 
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
