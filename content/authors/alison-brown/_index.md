title: Alison Brown
role: Department of Information Science, Dalhousie University
bio: "Alison Brown is a lecturer and doctoral student in the Department of Information Sciences at Dalhousie University. She studies how bringing people together to read aloud and discuss literature can strengthen relational wellbeing and support social inclusion in our diverse communities. This builds on her MLIS thesis work that explored the outcomes of a shared reading program for incarcerated mothers and their families. Alisonâ€™s teaching and research interests include community-led services, the sociology of reading, services and resources for children and young adults, and information experience. When not working, she takes long walks, hosts breakfast parties, curls up with books, and seeks sunshine (literal and metaphorical) with family and friends."
