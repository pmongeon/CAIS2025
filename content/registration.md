With the support of the [Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences EDID Initiatives Fund](https://www.federationhss.ca/en/programs-policy/funding-awards/edid-initiatives-fund), CAIS is pleased to offer a number of registration scholarships to BIPOC attendees. Please fill out [this application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17Qzd4pfK7RpLKgCiuwHPyxDYLNVRhFPd2WQxJoQJulQ/preview) if you wish to apply for a bursary. Please note that because virtual registration is free, bursaries will be given to in-person attendees only (accepted speakers will be prioritized). Bursaries will be awarded on a rolling basis until the fund has been dispersed. The form will remain open from March 15th-April 30th, 2025, or until all bursaries are allotted.
